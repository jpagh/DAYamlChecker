# DAYamlChecker

An LSP for Docassemble YAML Interviews

## How to run

```bash
pip install .
dayaml check              # defaults to the current project; usually scans ./docassemble
dayaml format             # defaults to the current project; usually scans ./docassemble
dayaml check path/to/yaml-or-dir
dayaml check --show-experimental path/to/yaml-or-dir
dayaml check --ignore-codes E410,E301 path/to/yaml-or-dir
dayaml check --format-on-success --no-url-check path/to/yaml-or-dir
dayaml format path/to/interview.yml

# Backwards-compatible entry points
python3 -m dayamlchecker          # defaults to the current project; usually scans ./docassemble
dayamlchecker                     # defaults to the current project; usually scans ./docassemble
python3 -m dayamlchecker `find . -name "*.yml" -path "*/questions/*" -not -path "*/.venv/*" -not -path "*/build/*"` # i.e. a space separated list of files
dayamlchecker `find . -name "*.yml" -path "*/questions/*" -not -path "*/.venv/*" -not -path "*/build/*"`
dayamlchecker-fmt path/to/interview.yml
```

## Message Codes

Validation output now includes stable message codes in the style of tools like pylint:

```text
[E301] At interview.yml:12: Keys that shouldn't exist! ['not_a_real_key']
```

Use `dayaml check --show-experimental ...` to include the legacy `REAL ERROR:`
prefix for non-experimental errors.

Use `dayaml check --ignore-codes E410,E301 ...` to suppress specific
diagnostic codes when you need to waive known findings.

`dayaml` also reads optional project settings from `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.dayaml]
ignore_codes = ["E503", "E410"]
yaml_path = "docassemble"
args = ["--no-url-check"]
```

When you pass a project root that contains `pyproject.toml`, `dayaml` scans the
configured `yaml_path` relative to that file. If `yaml_path` is omitted, it
defaults to `docassemble`.

When you omit file arguments, `dayaml check`, `dayaml format`, `dayamlchecker`,
and `dayamlchecker-fmt` all start from the current working directory. If that
directory contains a `pyproject.toml` (or is inside a project that does), they
then resolve `tool.dayaml.yaml_path` from the nearest project config. In the
common case where `yaml_path` is not set, the practical result is that running
these commands from a project root will scan `./docassemble`.

`tool.dayaml.args` lets you set checker CLI defaults in the project config.
Those args are applied before the actual command-line args, so an explicit CLI
flag still wins. For example, `args = ["--no-url-check"]` disables URL checks
by default, while `dayaml check --url-check ...` turns them back on for one run.

`dayaml check --format-on-success ...` validates each file first and then runs
the formatter on files that have no error-severity findings after ignore-code
filtering. This uses the already-read file content in memory, so it avoids a
separate checker-then-formatter pass over the same file. Formatting happens
before the later URL-check phase, so a run can still exit nonzero for URL
errors after formatting changes have already been written. Use
`--no-url-check` with this mode if you want the combined YAML-check-and-format
behavior without the later repository URL scan.

## WCAG checks

The checker includes WCAG-style checks for clear static accessibility failures in interview source. These checks run by default; use `--no-wcag` to disable them.

```bash
python3 -m dayamlchecker path/to/interview.yml          # WCAG checks on (default)
python3 -m dayamlchecker --no-wcag path/to/interview.yml  # WCAG checks off
python3 -m dayamlchecker --accessibility-error-on-widget combobox path/to/interview.yml  # opt into combobox accessibility errors
```

Some accessibility checks are behind runtime options while the rules are still being evaluated. Right now `combobox` failures are default-off and can be enabled with `--accessibility-error-on-widget combobox`.

## URL checks

The main `dayamlchecker` CLI also runs the URL checker by default. Broken URLs in question files fail the command; broken URLs in related `data/templates` files are warnings by default. Use `--no-url-check` to skip it, or tune it with flags such as `--url-check-timeout`, `--url-check-ignore-urls`, `--url-check-skip-templates`, `--template-url-severity`, and `--unreachable-url-severity`.

Current accessibility checks focus on objective failures only:

- Missing alt text in markdown images
- Missing alt text in Docassemble `[FILE ...]` image tags
- Missing alt text in HTML `<img>` tags
- Skipped markdown heading levels such as `##` to `####`
- Skipped HTML heading levels such as `<h2>` to `<h4>`
- Empty link text
- Non-descriptive link text such as `click here`, `here`, `read more`, and Spanish equivalents like `haga clic aquí`
- `no label` and empty/missing labels on multi-field screens (allowed on single-field screens)
- Low contrast in custom Bootstrap theme CSS loaded by `features: bootstrap theme`; inspects actual CSS values for body text, navbar, dropdown menu, and buttons (minimum ratio 4.5:1)

Optional runtime-gated accessibility checks:

- `combobox` usage, including `datatype: combobox` when `--accessibility-error-on-widget combobox` is enabled

Accessibility errors are also emitted for likely PDF accessibility issues:

- DOCX attachments missing `tagged pdf: True` (set this in `features` or on the attachment)

WCAG checks still report YAML parse errors, so CI/CD can surface broken YAML and accessibility failures in one run.

This mode is source-based static analysis. It does not audit rendered pages for runtime behavior or JavaScript-created accessibility issues.
